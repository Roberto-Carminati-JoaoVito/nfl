The NFL is constitute by 32 teams. 16 in the two conferences, the NFC and the AFC, in which there are four divisions, the NFC west, south, north and east, and the AFC's, north, east, west and south. 
After the season, the top 8 teams that wins their divisions go to the playoffs, but, the 2 teams with the best results in the conference that didn't win their divisions, go for the Wild Card. So, after that, we have 14 teams 
going for the playoffs for the chance of being the best NFL team at the year.
